# BedrockDedicatedServer
The scope of this project is personal with the potential for growth.

I am primarily using this repository as a training ground to learn, experiment and implement bash scripting into the deployment and maintenance of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server software.

I welcome all contributions.
